  “Your current position suggests you are unlikely to reach ten points before termination. I regret to inform you of this.”

  “I suppose I could trade you a brick for some ore. It won’t make me any happier, but go ahead.”

  “Look at you, struggling for victory points. Don’t worry, you’ll lose eventually. We all do.”
