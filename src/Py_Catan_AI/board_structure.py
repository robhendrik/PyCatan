"""BoardStructure module for Catan game board management and AI integration.

This module provides the core infrastructure for creating, managing, and analyzing
Catan game boards. It handles the complex geometric relationships between nodes,
edges, and tiles in a hexagonal grid layout, and provides essential functionality
for AI training and gameplay.

The module implements board coordinate calculations, neighbor relationships,
action space definitions, and logging capabilities necessary for training
machine learning models on Catan gameplay data.

Classes:
    BoardStructure: Main class for board geometry, relationships, and action spaces.

Examples:
    Basic usage:
        >>> from Py_Catan.BoardLayout import BoardLayout
        >>> layout = BoardLayout()
        >>> board = BoardStructure(layout)
        >>> print(f"Board has {board.no_of_nodes} nodes and {board.no_of_edges} edges")

    Creating action space for AI training:
        >>> board.included_actions = ["street", "village", "town", "trade_player"]
        >>> action_index = board.action_to_index(("street", 5))
        >>> original_action = board.index_to_action(action_index)

Attributes:
    NO_OF_PLAYERS_ON_BOARD (int): Default number of players (4).

Note:
    This module requires NumPy for mathematical operations and Matplotlib for
    plotting functionality. The BoardLayout class must be imported from the
    Py_Catan package.

    This class handles all geometric calculations, spatial relationships, and

    managing valid action spaces.
    
    The class calculates coordinates for nodes, edges, and tiles in a hexagonal

    positions, and manages action-to-index conversions for machine learning.
